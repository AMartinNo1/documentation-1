# Overview of the Ads Transparency Spotlight (Alpha) extension

Our new Ads Transparency Spotlight(Alpha) extension for Chrome is part of our ongoing initiative to give people more visibility into the data used to personalize ads and more control over that data. Ultimately, we hope this will lead to better, industry-wide ads transparency and control for users.

This first version of the extension is an early-stage proof of concept that displays the data used to tailor the ads you see, who is serving the ads, and companies with a presence on the web page. We are currently exploring other controls for users.

At the time of this alpha release (July 2020), the extension only shows information about those ads purchased through Google Ads that have implemented the Ads Transparency Spotlight(Alpha) Data Disclosure schema. As additional ad tech providers implement this schema, information about these ads will also appear in the extension. Over time, we hope the industry will incorporate the Ads Transparency Spotlight(Alpha) Data Disclosure schema into their ads.

## Information you can view in the extension

The Ads Transparency Spotlight extension displays the following information about the ads and other services that appear on a web page and have incorporated the Ads Transparency Spotlight (Alpha) Data Disclosure schema.

### Ads tab

The “Ads” tab displays information about ads, including the ad technology providers whose services facilitated serving the ad and the reasons a user was shown the ad. At the time of releasing this first version of the extension, it can show information about many display ads purchased through Google Ads (these ads have implemented a new Ad Disclosure Schema). Over time, we hope that the industry will incorporate the Ad Disclosure Schema into their ads’ HTML.

You can view the following types of information about the ads on a web page:

- **Detailed information about the ads on the page**, including how many ads are on the page.
- **A list of ad providers responsible for delivering ads to the page**. These companies serve ads or provide the ad technology to help ads appear on this page.
- **The reasons why ads are shown on a page**. A combination of several factors that decide which ad will be shown on a page:
   - **Your demographics**: May include age, gender, and other information (provided by you or inferred).
   - **Marketing campaign**: A visit to the advertiser’s website added you to a marketing campaign.
   - **Your location, general**: Broad location, such as country or city.
   - **Your interests**: Topics related to websites you have visited or interests you provided.
   - **Context**: Topics shown to anyone who visits this page.
   - **Other information**: All other reasons.
   - **Your location, specific**: Your specific location, including latitude and longitude.

### Entities tab

The “Entities” tab displays information about other companies and services not already listed on the Ads tab that have a presence on web pages. 

The companies shown on this tab are specific to the web page you’re viewing. These companies provide a wide variety of services, including cloud data storage, cloud computing, and analytics. Companies have different approaches to protecting your data and privacy. For details about how your data is used, read the company’s privacy policy.
